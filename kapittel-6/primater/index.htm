                <p>Between 2011 and 2018, a series of disputes took place about the copyright status of selfies taken by
                    Celebes crested macaques using equipment belonging to the British wildlife photographer David J.
                    Slater. The disputes involved Wikimedia Commons and the blog Techdirt, which have hosted the images
                    following their publication in newspapers in July 2011 over Slater's objections that he holds the
                    copyright, and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), who have argued that the
                    copyright should be assigned to the macaque.</p>

            <h4>Slater </h4>
            <p>Slater has argued that he has a valid copyright claim because he engineered the situation that resulted in the pictures by travelling to Indonesia, befriending a group of wild macaques, and setting up his camera equipment in such a way that a selfie might come about. The Wikimedia Foundation's 2014 refusal to remove the pictures from its Wikimedia Commons image library was based on the understanding that copyright is held by the creator, that a non-human creator (not being a legal person) cannot hold copyright, and that the images are thus in the public domain.

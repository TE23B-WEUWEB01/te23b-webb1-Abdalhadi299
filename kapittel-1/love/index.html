    <h2>artikel om låten</h2>
    <p>All You Need Is Love" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles that was released as a non-album single in
        July 1967, with "Baby, You're a Rich Man" as its B-side. It was written by John Lennon[4] and credited to the
        Lennon–McCartney partnership. The song was Britain's contribution to Our World, the first live global television
        link, for which the band were filmed performing it at EMI Studios in London on 25 June. The programme was
        broadcast via satellite and seen by an audience of over 400 million in 25 countries. Lennon's lyrics were
        deliberately simplistic, to allow for broad appeal to the show's international audience, and captured the
        utopian ideals associated with the Summer of Love. The single topped sales charts in Britain, the United States
        and many other countries, and became an anthem for the counterculture's embrace of flower power philosophy.</p>
